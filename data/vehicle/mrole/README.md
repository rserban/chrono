The Chrono::Vehicle MROLE (Multirole Vehicle) is a simplified model for the 'Boxer' vehicle, produced by KMW (Krauss Maffay Wegman) and RLS (Rheinmetall Landsysteme).

The engine, drivetrain, and suspension models approximate well the original design, based on data of the manufacturers.

The steering system is simplified but functional. Details of any military MROLE modules are not publicly available.
